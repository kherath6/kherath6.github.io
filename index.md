This all needs to be changed later in ........


This is a test and not my genuine information.


I was born on 12 January 1993 in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. Growing up
in a working class family and neighborhood, I developed an interest in rap, R&B,
and boxing. I auditioned for The X Factor when I was 17, and though I was
eliminated in the final round of competition, I became a part of the boy band
One Direction.

Aside from being an entertainer, in my spare time I focus on providing technical
leadership and hands on programming for a portfolio of digital library projects.
I am passionate about the impact of technology on libraries and higher education,
and work to integrate this passion into my current projects.
